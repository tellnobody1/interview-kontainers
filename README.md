# interview-kontainers

> I have feedback from VP Technology and the team. Unfortunately, it's not good news, even though they felt you were very technically capable. During the technical interview with the team, you appeared quite single-minded on solutions to problems. You didn't seem to be open to taking on suggestions from the team to implement a different style. They felt that this could cause a fair amount of friction within teams if you were to join.
